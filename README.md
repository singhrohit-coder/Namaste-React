# Namaste-React Series 🚀
<br>
Hello Developers 👋 Welcome to the Namaste React Series! This repository documents my journey of learning React, structured like a web series. Each episode focuses on a new concept, technique, or project that I'm exploring. 


**How it Works ⚒️**
<br>

Each **Episode** in this series covers a different aspect of React. As I learn the basics, I'll break down key concepts, share practical examples, and update this repository with new lessons. This way, I can track my progress, improve my skills, and help others learning React.
